Screensaver for beautiful pictures on the Mac

This screensaver presents your pictures as a "slide show" or "picture flow".
It has basic animations (zoom in/out, Ken Burns, or nothing), but it lets you
customize these much more than Apple's built-in slide show screensaver.
It is mostly geared towards people who want to see their collection of beautiful images 
as large as possible, and with some information which one of their images they are seeing.

I think, ArtSaver also handles huge image collections, which can be scattered about 
many subfolders, better than Apple's built-in picture screen saver, 
because it builds a database of the images and stores it on disk,
rather than scanning the folders every time it gets invoked.

There is no code here, I merely use Github for a bit of bug/issue tracking, in case people prefer that.
